Despite this, Jank stuck with the original artwork, labeling it as the "rap version of Beauty and the Beast". A small orange square was added to the final version of Madvillainy, due to Jank\'s thinking that the artwork "needed something distinctive", comparing it to the orange "O" on the Madonna cover.',

They used a font similar to placards used in boxing matches to represent abrasive masculinity, which was contrasted by the greyish-pink font which they described as "a subversion of femininity".',

Saville had originally planned to use a Renaissance portrait of a dark prince to tie in with the Machiavellian theme of the title, but could not find a suitable portrait. At the gallery Saville picked up a postcard with Fantin-Latour’s painting, and his girlfriend mockingly asked him if he was going to use it for the cover. Fashion designer Raf Simons and street-fashion label Supreme have both used the cover in their collections.',

The iconic imagery would continue to pop up throughout Tribe’s career (gracing the covers of their next two albums), making the painted lady hip-hop’s most recognizable mascot.

These extremes would reflect the different textures, breadth, and depth of the album." Hung says that the band wanted a cover that touched on those themes and that also had a "rawer feel" to give a sense of how the record came together in Hong Kong (the band recorded quickly, in a small studio in the city).',
