Despite this, Jank stuck with the original artwork, labeling it as the "rap version of Beauty and the Beast". A small orange square was added to the final version of Madvillainy, due to Jank\'s thinking that the artwork "needed something distinctive", comparing it to the orange "O" on the Madonna cover.',

        info: 'Todd Tourso, who directed the videos for "Jealous" and "Heaven", served as the creative director for the entire project. Over three months he considered over a hundred options, only to proceed with his very first idea. He was inspired by the cover of Metallica’s eponymous fifth studio album (1991) to create a bold statement, specifically to deviate from a "beauty shot" of Beyoncé which he felt would be expected. They used a font similar to placards used in boxing matches to represent abrasive masculinity, which was contrasted by the greyish-pink font which they described as "a subversion of femininity".',
