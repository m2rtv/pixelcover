Saville had originally planned to use a Renaissance portrait of a dark prince to tie in with the Machiavellian theme of the title, but could not find a suitable portrait. At the gallery Saville picked up a postcard with Fantin-Latour’s painting, and his girlfriend mockingly asked him if he was going to use it for the cover. Fashion designer Raf Simons and street-fashion label Supreme have both used the cover in their collections.',

Painting the contours of an invisible model’s body with glow-in-the-dark paint, the red, green, and black image was sexy and Afrocentric all at once—a delicate balance that mirrored Tribe’s jazz-heavy sound at the time. The iconic imagery would continue to pop up throughout Tribe’s career (gracing the covers of their next two albums), making the painted lady hip-hop’s most recognizable mascot. Stripped-down, stylish, and original, The Low End Theory is everything a great rap album cover should be.” via Conplex. AD: ZombArt, Photography: Joe Gran1',

It’s not going to be pretty. It’s not going to be perfect. It’s going to get a little gritty, and it might get a little intense, but it’s a conversation we need to have.” I wanted to nod to the Mona Lisa and the stateliness, the sternness that that image has.”',
